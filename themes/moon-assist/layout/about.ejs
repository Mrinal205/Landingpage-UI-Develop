                  Moon Assist was founded by a group of developers, designers and crypto trading professionals who firmly believe cryptocurrencies will reshape our financial system. We believe in a new system where trust and ownership is distributed to individuals through decentralized technologies rather than left in the hands of regulators and third party intermediaries.

            <p>
              Cryptocurrencies are building a more open economy from the ground up, replacing legacy finance with distributed technology. We see these new systems offering people better access to financial services and greater control over their assets. Crypto is restoring power to the people.
