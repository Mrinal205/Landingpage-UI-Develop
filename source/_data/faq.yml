        title: How do I use the stop market function?
        content:
          A stop-market requires the setting of one price point. The point initiates the start of the action, the stop, and once in the designated range, will execute at the latest market price.


          For example, assume that XYZ Coin is trading at $5 and a trader wants to buy the coin once it begins showing upward momentum. The trader puts a stop-market order to buy with the stop price at $6 and execute at the latest market price at or above that price. Similarly, the stop-market sell enables the same function in the other direction.


          The benefit of a stop-market order is that a trader has the guarantee over when an order will be filled.

      -
        title: How do I use the trailing stop function?
        content:
          The trailing stop is more flexible than a fixed stop-market since it automatically tracks the coin’s price direction and does not have to be manually reset like the fixed stop-market.


          For example, the market price of Ethereum is $480, and you placed a Stop Sell Order at $450, which is in our case $30 below the current market price. Suppose the price of Ethereum suddenly increases to $550. You are now in a chance of “locking in” even bigger profit by manually repositioning your Stop Sell Order to the higher price.


          Repositioning your Stop Order can be done automatically for you by enabling “Trailing Stop” function. In our case, Trailing Stop Order will automatically reposition active Stop Order if the price of Ethereum increases while maintaining the spread of $30 between the Ethereum’s spot price and Stop Order.

        title: How do I convert directly between coins?
        content:
          Converting between coins lets you sell a position directly into the denomination of any other coin available on the exchange you are trading on. Coin converting is designed to remove the intermediary step of selling into BTC or ETH denominated markets when moving between positions.


          For example, assume you want to rebalance your portfolio out of EOS and towards ZRX. You can sell an amount of EOS directly into a ZRX position without the intermediary step of first selling into the BTC or ETH markets.

        title: How do I set-up buy/sell signals?
        content:
          Signal buy/sell will allow you to anticipate specific price movements within a given period.


          For example, assume you want to buy Ethereum with a specific amount of available Bitcoin you have in your wallet. You decide you want to buy 1 Bitcoin worth of Ethereum. By telling our platform you want to buy Ethereum after a 10% growth in 2 hours, it will automatically buy Ethereum if the specific event happened within the determined time. It will spend 1 Bitcoin to buy your wanted Ethereum.


          Similarly, the sell signal enables the same function in the other direction.
